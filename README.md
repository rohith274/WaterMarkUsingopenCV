Abstract :
   Anybody can simply copy the work of others in this developed world. So, marking
   them is more important i.e,, using watermarking helps in more security to our files
   and this works as a copyright for the image.
      - Change the branch to (Application) to see the flask app code.
      - NoteBook is added in the main branch.
      - This is a detailed and must read report for the project.
  This is the process I followed to complete this project.I used an open CV for this project.
      1. I loaded the images and logo/text from url
      2. Resizing the image
      3. Converted the images into rgb and numpy
      4. Then stored the height and width of image and logo
      5. Then found out the centre of the image
      6. If needed we can add the watermark in the centre else we can give the data/
      coordinates to add the logo/watermark.
      7. Merging the both logo and the image.
      8. Adding more text for convenience and then finally I converted into rgb again for
      visualising the expected output.
Everything is clearly explained in the main file itself. Now you can refer to the main file for
more understanding of the code.
